# Assignment-2-Grade-Calculator

**Description:**
I tried doing the math but couldn't quite figure out how to make vectors with QObjects that have already been created by the ui because the copy assignment function seems to have been deleted.

I tried to make the radiobuttons signal that the grade should be recalculated with the new scheme but I haven't found the right signal yet. The pushbutton I added to fix the issue isn't really working either.
